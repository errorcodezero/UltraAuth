# UltraAuth

Welcome to UltraAuth! This is a console application(it needs to be run in a terminal). This is not part of any companies. This project uses .NET 5.0 so you may want to have that installed. 

Here is how to set up the application(clone the repository and then after that get rid of git from it): 
1. Open the files in your preferred text editor
2. Navigate to the file called Program.cs
3. Go to the part in the program that has the comment "// Password and Username"
4. Underneath that you will see 2 strings which have a value; Edit the value inside of the quotation marks to your preferred password and username
5. Run it and use your new passoword!

I hope you enjoy this software!
