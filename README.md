# UltraAuth-

Welcome to UltraAuth! This is a console application(it needs to be run in a terminal). This is not part of any companies. 

Here is how to set up the application(clone the repository and then after that get rid of git from it): 
1. Open the files in your preferred text editor
2. Navigate to the file called Program.cs
3. Go to the part in the program that has the comment "// Password and Username"
4. Underneath that you will see 2 strings which have a value; Edit the value inside of the quotation marks to your preferred password and username
5. Run it and use your new passoword!

I hope you enjoy this software!
